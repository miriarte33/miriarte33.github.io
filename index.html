          <h2 id="Label1">ABOUT ME:</h2>
          <p>
            I am a hardworking student from Miami, Florida with a 3.65 GPA. My current interests include App and Web development, Shell Scripting, and Software Engineering. I hope to one day have a job in one of those fields, but I like to think I will always be able to improve in all of them through personal endeavors. My greatest motivation is my brother, who suffers from autism. I try to help him in whatever way I can when I am home from college, but when I am not there I help him by becoming the best person I can be and putting myself in a position to be successful so that I may one day dedicate myself to taking care of his needs.
          </p>
          <h2 id="Label2">PROJECTS:</h2>
          <ul> This is a list of some of the projects I am most proud of in order of when they were completed. Of course I have done plenty of projects since I began coding in 2016, but as my new projects become more complex, I remove old ones from the list. They were all very fun to make, and they will show my level of proficiency with different coding languages.

          <ul> My education means the world to me. Belen is where I gained the foundation to become the kind of person I aspire to be, and Fordham is where I have continued that education to learn in what career to make my mark. Udacity gave me the amazing opportunity to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from Google developers for no cost at all, and I thank them very much for that.

          <h2 id="Label5">VOLUNTEER WORK:</h2>
          <ul> All of these experiences have left a lasting impression on me. BYM taught me a lot I didn't know about the world and how the majority of people live in it, which was truly humbling. Belen Guardians was my way of learning how I can help my brother as he gets older, as well as learn more about autism. The little things I did at Coral Park were just because I liked the principal and the school and wanted to make sure the students there had the same positive experience that I did. I honestly hope more opportunities like these present themselves to me in the future.
